Special requirements for protection and network zone concepts can also be flexibly and easily mapped using additional measures. This particularly includes the ability to define application classes, operate in multiple, separate clusters, and automatically distribute workloads to protection zones and fire compartments.

System administration and specialist administration must be carried out in accordance with the respective specifications.\nSnapshots for persistent volumes are supported when using OpenShift's Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. OpenShift offers an easily configurable backup system with the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).\nAdditional third-party solutions for backup are also available in the OperatorHub.\nThe checks are not checking the requirement in detail. They only setup a foundation to implement the configurations as described. For Section 3,4 and 6 a GitOps approach might achieve the best results. for 2 and 7 a sufficient backup solution is needed. 5 can be achieved with onboard utilities. 8 is dependend on the CSI provider and the available features",

To isolate one or more pods in a project, you need to create NetworkPolicy objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming connections. If a pod is matched by selectors in one or more NetworkPolicy objects, then the pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those NetworkPolicy objects. A pod that is not selected by any NetworkPolicy objects is fully accessible.\nIt is useful to create default policies for each application namespace e.g. to deny all ingress traffic by default. The existance of at least one network policy and the automatic creation as part of a namespace template is checked using rules.\nThe creation of suitable NetworkPolicy objects that satisfy the requirements from sections 1 to 3, however, needs to be ensured by the application owner.

If a restart-based approach is chosen, the adequacy needs to be ensured organizationally.\nSection 2: The availability of all required resources for operation after restart in a different site needs to be ensured organizationally. Regular tests are essential. The availability of persistent data used by pods requires the storage inside of PVs/PVCs and a storage provider, that is also available at the alternative site.\nSection 3: The OpenShift control plane is evenly distributed across the control plane nodes out-of-the box. If the control plane nodes are distributed across failure zones, the control plane is hence prone to node or zone outage. For infrastructure and application workloads, a distribution across nodes and zones needs to be configured during deployment using affinity / anti-affinity rules or topology spread constraints.\nSingle Node OpenShift (SNO) is not highly available and therefore incompliant to this control.",

Special requirements for protection and network zone concepts can also be flexibly and easily mapped using additional measures. This particularly includes the ability to define application classes, operate in multiple, separate clusters, and automatically distribute workloads to protection zones and fire compartments.

The incoming connections can be bound to these and, by using Egress-IP, the outgoing connections can also be bound. Section 3: OpenShift uses control plane nodes for management, on which no applications are running. Data connections between applications to the outside world and to one another are not routed via the control plane as standard. The necessary requirements must be taken into account as part of the planning. Section 4: OpenShift Data Foundation (ODF) can be linked to its own infra nodes using the OpenShift mechanisms, which only run storage services. This can be implemented equivalently with other storage solutions.",

Therefore, the control is mostly inheretly met when using CoreOS for all nodes.\nSection 1: OpenShift uses an internal Certificate Authority (CA). The nodes (kubelet to API server and MachineConfig daemon to MachineConfig server) are communicating using node-specific certificates, signed by this CA.

In OpenShift, the default plugin (OVN-Kubernetes) supports using network policy. Support for NetworkPolicy objects is verified using rules.\nSection 1-3: By default, all pods in a project are accessible from other pods and network endpoints. To isolate one or more pods in a project, you need to create NetworkPolicy objects in that project to indicate the allowed incoming connections. If a pod is matched by selectors in one or more NetworkPolicy objects, then the pod will accept only connections that are allowed by at least one of those NetworkPolicy objects. A pod that is not selected by any NetworkPolicy objects is fully accessible.\nIt is useful to create default policies for each application namespace e.g. to deny all ingress traffic by default. The existance of at least one network policy and the automatic creation as part of a namespace template is checked using rules.\nThe creation of suitable NetworkPolicy objects that satisfy the requirements from sections 1 to 3, however, needs to be ensured by the application owner. A manual rule is provided for that.\nSection 4: It needs to be ensured organizationally, that only required subjects are granted RBAC to change the relevant Kubernetes objects.",

To achieve\ncontinued operation without interruption, nodes of every role need to be spread across zones. For quorum-based applications, such as the Kubernetes control plane, three zones are required. A sufficient number of control plane nodes and sufficient spreading across zones is checked using rules. If a restart-based approach is chosen, the adequacy needs to be ensured organizationally.\nSection 2: The availability of all required resources for operation after restart in a different site needs to be ensured organizationally. Regular tests are essential. The availability of persistent data used by pods requires the storage inside of PVs/PVCs and a storage provider, that is also available at the alternative site.\nSection 3: The OpenShift control plane is evenly distributed across the control plane nodes out-of-the box. If the control plane nodes are distributed across failure zones, the control plane is hence prone to node or zone outage. For infrastructure and application workloads, a distribution across nodes and zones needs to be configured during deployment using affinity / anti-affinity rules or topology spread constraints.\nSingle Node OpenShift (SNO) is not highly available and therefore incompliant to this control.",
