Special requirements for protection and network zone concepts can also be flexibly and easily mapped using additional measures. This particularly includes the ability to define application classes, operate in multiple, separate clusters, and automatically distribute workloads to protection zones and fire compartments.

System administration and specialist administration must be carried out in accordance with the respective specifications.\nSnapshots for persistent volumes are supported when using OpenShift's Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. OpenShift offers an easily configurable backup system with the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).\nAdditional third-party solutions for backup are also available in the OperatorHub.\nThe checks are not checking the requirement in detail.

                "description": "The data backup of a cluster must be individually defined as part of the system architecture as part of the operating model. The areas of responsibility for the container platform (cluster administration), the infrastructure services (system administration) and the application management (technical administration) should be considered separately.\nFor data backup as part of cluster administration (Kubernetes configuration, current state of the Kubernetes cluster, configuration database) the integrated functions or methods of OpenShift must be used. System administration and specialist administration must be carried out in accordance with the respective specifications.\nSnapshots for persistent volumes are supported when using OpenShift's Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. OpenShift offers an easily configurable backup system with the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).\nAdditional third-party solutions for backup are also available in the OperatorHub.\nThe checks are not checking the requirement in detail. They only setup a foundation to implement the configurations as described. For Section 3,4 and 6 a GitOps approach might achieve the best results. for 2 and 7 a sufficient backup solution is needed. 5 can be achieved with onboard utilities. 8 is dependend on the CSI provider and the available features",

Special requirements for protection and network zone concepts can also be flexibly and easily mapped using additional measures. This particularly includes the ability to define application classes, operate in multiple, separate clusters, and automatically distribute workloads to protection zones and fire compartments.

The areas of responsibility for the container platform (cluster administration), the infrastructure services (system administration) and the application management (technical administration) should be considered separately.\nFor data backup as part of cluster administration (Kubernetes configuration, current state of the Kubernetes cluster, configuration database) the integrated functions or methods of OpenShift must be used. System administration and specialist administration must be carried out in accordance with the respective specifications.\nSnapshots for persistent volumes are supported when using OpenShift's Container Storage Interface (CSI) drivers. OpenShift offers an easily configurable backup system with the OpenShift API for Data Protection (OADP).\nAdditional third-party solutions for backup are also available in the OperatorHub.\nThe checks are not checking the requirement in detail. They only setup a foundation to implement the configurations as described. For Section 3,4 and 6 a GitOps approach might achieve the best results. for 2 and 7 a sufficient backup solution is needed. 5 can be achieved with onboard utilities. 8 is dependend on the CSI provider and the available features",

Depending on the protection requirement, Kubernetes secrets can be secured via an (encrypted) etcd metadata store or additionally via an integration of Vault components or \"sealed secrets\" for CD and GitOps mechanisms.
